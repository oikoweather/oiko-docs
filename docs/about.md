# About Oikolab

We started Oikolab to make climate and weather data easier to work with. We're a small operation but we take pride in the fact that we run one of the largest and most comprehensive weather data repositories in the world.

Since 2018, we have processed more than a petabyte of data and we continue to process multiple terabytes of data every day.
